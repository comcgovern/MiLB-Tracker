1. ~~need to fix unreadable text in headers in night mode on dashboard cards~~ FIXED: Changed invalid `dark:bg-gray-750` to `dark:bg-gray-700` in DashboardCard.tsx
2. ~~need to figure out some way to prune players from the index who havent played a minor league game in over a year~~ FIXED: Added pruning logic to build_player_index.py - players inactive for 365+ days are now automatically removed from the index
3. ~~refresh button doesnt do anything. not sure what its supposed to do, maybe refresh the player index but i think we can just get rid of it~~ FIXED: Removed the refresh button from DataStatusIndicator.tsx
4. long term, maybe we can look at more frequent refresh of data during the season so its basically live data? not sure how realistic this is - SHELVED for now; updated schedule to run at 12:01 AM UTC nightly
