1. need to fix unreadable text in headers in night mode on dashboard cards
2. need to figure out some way to prune players from the index who havent played a minor league game in over a year
3. refresh button doesnt do anything. not sure what its supposed to do, maybe refresh the player index but i think we can just get rid of it
4. long term, maybe we can look at more frequent refresh of data during the season so its basically live data? not sure how realistic this is
